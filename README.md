# GPS Tracking Platform

This project should provide you possibility to see
your vehicle (supported GPS device) on real map.

## Preparation to run it on dev.mode.

Before you start server & client in development mode you have to bundle
all client related meteor packages. To do that run `npm run meteor-client`
and wait for a while.

If you install some additional package via `npm` you'll need to
bundle it again.

Run `npm run server` to start a server in dev mode.

Run `npm run client` to start a client in dev mode.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
